In a fitting finale to what has been a glorious career, the 40-year-old batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar was on Saturday chosen for the prestigious Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, making him the first sportsperson to be bestowed with the honour.</p><p> The Prime Minister's Office made the announcement hours after Tendulkar brought down the curtains on a 24-year international career. Tendulkar, who became the first active sportsperson to become a Rajya Sabha member last year, is being given the honour along with Professor CNR Rao, the man behind India's maiden Mars mission. </p><p>Previous recipients of the Bharat Ratna include Nobel laureates Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa.</p><p>In 2008, Tendulkar became the first sportsperson, along with chess grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, to receive the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian honour. Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award (a national award for distinguished sports persons) in 1994, and in 1998 he received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the country's highest sporting honour.</p><p> The next year, he was the recipient of the Padma Shri ( the fourth-highest civilian award). </p>
