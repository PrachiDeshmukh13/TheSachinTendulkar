After some initial hiccups, there has not been any real stumbling block in cricketing carrier of this"Bombay Bomber". The little genius, as Sachin is fondly called, has been performing consistently for the country ever since he started playing cricket for India. But every champion has some lean patches, Sachin too had some.</p><p>
Sachin's tremendous performances soon elevated him to the most challenging task of captaining the Indian side. But sadly this pressure had its toll on Sachin's batting. Many criticize Sachin of not delivering the goods in crunch situations. In recent years Sachin has not been in scintillating of forms and his genius has been visible only in parts. While criticizing him we must not forget that Sachin has been round the corner for the last 16 years.
