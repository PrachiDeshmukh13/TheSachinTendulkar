•  He embarked on his domestic first-class career in 1988 playing for Mumbai and scored a century on his very first match. He ended the season as the highest run scorer.</p><p>
•  His performance in the first-class matches had been so mind blowing that he got selected into the national team after just one season. He made his international test debut against Pakistan in November 1989 aged just 16.</p><p>
•  Even though he could not score many runs in the series, he got noticed both for his batting techniques and his dedication to the sport. He also made his debut in One Day International (ODI) in 1989.</p><p>
•  During the 1991-92 tour of Australia, he made 148 runs in one of the matches and 114 in another, batting against the great bowlers of that time like Merv Hughes, Craig Mcdermott and Bruce Reid.</p><p>
•  Asked to open the batting against Zealand in an ODI 1994, he set the stadium on fire blasting 82 runs off just 49 balls. The very same year he made his first ODI century against Australia.</p><p>
•  In 1998 Australia was on a tour of India and the series was hyped as Sachin versus Warne contest. Sachin blasted Warne in the series and made two centuries in the three-test series. Sachin played a vital role in India’s win in the series. </p><p>
•  Sachin had two brief stints as captain of Indian cricket team and both of them were not very successful. He took over as captain in 1996 but the team performed poorly and he gave up the captaincy in 1997. He was again made the captain in 1999 but again he was not very successful and gave up the captaincy in 1999.</p><p>
•  India was one of the favorites in the Cricket World Cup 2003 where he performed superbly, making 673 runs in 11 matches to help India reach the finals. The team however lost the finals to Australia though Sachin was given Man of the Tournament Award.</p><p>
•  His form faltered after the World Cup and he went through a lean phase. He retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 and was given a very emotional farewell by his fans.</p><p>
