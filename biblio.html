Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai. Sachin's father, Ramesh Tendulkar was a professor of Marathi. Seeing loads of promises in his younger brother, Ajit Tendulkar (Sachin's brother) decided to guide Sachin in the early stages of his life. Ajit took his kid brother to Mr. Ramakant Achrekar, arguably the best cricket coach of his times. It was because of cricket that Sachin had to change his school and had to stay at his uncle's place.</p><p>
 
Mr. Achrekar was thoroughly impressed by this little boy. Achrekar could see the world champion in this little boy. He was satisfied beyond doubt that Sachin had huge potential and hunger to succeed at the highest level. Slowly and gradually Sachin started making waves in the local cricket of Mumbai. And it was not long before Sachin got to play his first Ranji trophy match against Gujarat in 1988-89. Sachin went on to make 100 not out in his very debut 1st class match; it was not a surprise for those who knew him!</p>
